# Roomba Robots Simulation 

Roomba is a series of autonomous robotic vacuum cleaners. 
These cleaners have a set of sensors that enable them to navigate the floor area of a home. 
The sensors can detect the presence of obstacles, particularly dirty spots on the floor and the vacum cleaner is able to clean this dirty spots.


In this simulation we can preview the behaviour of these machines:
